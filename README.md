## Background

### Portfolio

 The portfolio will consist of 5 equally weighted stocks. We chose MSFT (Microsoft), AMZN (Amazon),
 BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway B), XOM (Exxon Mobile), and K (Kellogg's).

 The portfolio will have $50,000 total, and we will put $10,000 into each stock.

### Hypothesis

 It's better to train different machine learning models to outperform a standard portfolio, using historical stock closing prices.

### Models

 **Loops were also utilized to create Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation graphs for each stock in the porfolio.**

 1) ARMA - Autoregressive Moving Average

 2) ARIMA - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average 
 
#### Linear Regression Forecasting

#### Classification Forecasting

### Considerations

Amazon was substituted for Tesla, because Alpaca API was unable to get adjusted closing prices for Tesla. This proved problematic, because Tesla had a stock split of 5-1, which affected the price from $2,000 to $400.
